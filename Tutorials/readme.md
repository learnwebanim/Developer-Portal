## Welcome to the Tutorials folder
The **Tutorials** folder is a collection of step-by-step guides on various programming topics, tools, and concepts.  Whether you're explaining basic syntax, complex algorithms, or specific libraries and frameworks, the goal is to help developers understand and apply new skills.

**What to Contribute?**
- **Basic Tutorials:** Introductory guides aimed at beginners.  These should cover foundational topics such as variables, loops, functions, and control flow.
- **Intermediate Tutorials:** Tutorials that go deeper into programming concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithm implementation.
- **Advanced Tutorials:** Advanced concepts such as design patterns, performance tuning, API development, and real-world application of programming principles.

**Guidelines:**
- Make sure your tutorial is easy to follow, with detailed explanations.
- Provide examples, code snippets, and screenshots (if applicable).
- Avoid jargon where possible, and define any technical terms you use.
- Consider including a **Resources** section at the end with additional reading or links to related topics.

This folder contains educational resources and tutorials designed to help developers enhance their coding skills.  It is divided into two main sections:
- **Language_Specific:** Tutorials that focus on specific programming languages, offering foundational knowledge, common patterns, and best practices.
- **Techniques:** Tutorials on broader coding concepts, methodologies, and techniques that can be applied across various languages and technologies.

Whether you're looking to deepen your knowledge in a particular language or understand important coding techniques, these tutorials will provide valuable insights.

Tutorials should empower developers to learn by doing.  Whether it's a small snippet or a deep dive, your contribution can make a big impact!

### Contribution Guidelines
Contributors are encouraged to submit tutorials to either the **Language_Specific** or **Techniques** section based on the nature of the material:
- For **Language_Specific**, make sure the tutorial is clearly tied to a specific programming language.
- For **Techniques**, focus on providing tutorials that are language-agnostic or related to coding techniques applicable across various platforms.

All submissions should follow the repository's **contribution guidelines** and include code examples, clear explanations, and references where applicable.
