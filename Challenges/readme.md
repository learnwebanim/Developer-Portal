## Welcome to the Coding Challenges folder
This folder is home to the **Coding Challenges**.  Coding challenges are practical exercises designed to improve a developer's problem-solving skills by applying algorithms and programming techniques.

**What to Contribute?**
- **Basic Challenges:** Simple exercises that involve basic data manipulation, sorting, and control structures.  Perfect for beginners.
- **Intermediate Challenges:** More complex problems involving recursion, searching and sorting algorithms, or the implementation of data structures like stacks, queues, and trees.
- **Advanced Challenges:** These should test a developer's understanding of optimization, dynamic programming, or involve a multi-threading and concurrency challenges.

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on explaining the **approach** rather than simply providing the solution.
- Ensure challenges are well-explained and include a problem statement, input/output expectations, and constraints.
- Include a sample input/output and, optionally, edge cases to think about.

These challenges should push developers to think critically and improve their coding skills.  Clear explanations and hints are welcome!
