### Welcome to the Beginner Projects folder!
Here, we collect beginner-level project ideas to help developers learn and grow by working on practical, hands-on projects.

**What to Contribute?**
Simple, small-scale projects that are ideal for developers just starting out.  These projects should focus on basic concepts like loops, conditionals, and basic data structures.

**Guidelines:**

- Provide clear instructions for setting up the project environment.
- Include code comments and explanations where necessary.
- If applicable, add a **README.md** file that outlines the project scope, goals, and any dependencies.

By contributing here, you're helping other developers learn through practical coding challenges!
