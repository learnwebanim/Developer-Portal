## Welcome to the Interview Questions folder
In the **Interview Questions** folder, we aim to provide guidance on solving common programming interview questions.  Instead of providing direct solutions, this folder focuses on **how to approach** interview questions logically and methodically.

**What to Contribute?**
- **Basic Interview Questions:** Simple questions typically seen in entry-level positions.  Topics include arrays, strings, and basic algorithmic tasks like searching and sorting.
- **Intermediate Interview Questions:** More involved problems that test knowledge of recursion, dynamic programming, or common data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Advanced Interview Questions:** These are often used in senior-level interviews and involve complex algorithmic thinking, system design, or real-time data processing.

**Guidelines:**
- Break down the question and explain the logic behind the solution, step-by-step.
- Highlight different approaches (e.g., brute force, optimized, etc.) and explain why one approach may be better.
- Provide space for hints or thought processes that might help someone figure out the solution on their own.
- Focus on clarity and teaching **problem-solving strategies** rather than giving complete answers.

The goal here is to help developers not only prepare for interviews but also learn how to approach and break down complex problems during technical interviews.

This folder contains a curated collection of interview questions designed to help developers prepare for technical interviews.  The questions are divided into two key sections:
- **General:** Common interview questions applicable to a wide range of positions and industries.
- **Tech_Specific:** Questions focused on particular technologies, languages, and frameworks.

By exploring both sections, contributors can build a comprehensive understanding of interview techniques and expectations.

### Contribution Guidelines
Contributors are encouraged to submit interview questions to either the **General** or **Tech_Specific** section based on the nature of the question:
- For **General**, submit questions that are broadly applicable across technical interviews, regardless of specific tech skills.
- For **Tech_Specific**, submit questions that target specific technologies, frameworks, or programming languages.  Make sure to clarify the expected answers or considerations related to that specific tech.

Contributions should follow the repository's **contribution guidelines** and provide clear and well-explained answers where applicable, along with references or explanations of concepts.
