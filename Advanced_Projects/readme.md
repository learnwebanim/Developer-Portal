## Welcome to the Advanced Projects folder!
Here, we collect advanced-level project ideas to help developers learn and grow by working on practical, hands-on projects.

**What to Contribute?**
Projects that require deeper knowledge of algorithms, design patterns, frameworks, or performance optimization.  Contributions should be well-structured and guide experienced developers through complex problem-solving scenarios.

**Guidelines:**
- Provide clear instructions for setting up the project environment.
- Include code comments and explanations where necessary.
- If applicable, add a **README.md** file that outlines the project scope, goals, and any dependencies.

By contributing here, you're helping other developers learn through practical coding challenges!
