# Advanced Project Template

**Project Title:**

An informative title that hints at the complexity of the project.

**Overview:**

Give a thorough explanation of the project. Explain the high-level goals and challenges of the project.
- **Objective**: What will the contributor master? (e.g., complex system design, optimization techniques, building full-stack applications)

**Technologies/Languages:**

List the required technologies (e.g., Docker, AWS, MongoDB, React, Django).

**Prerequisites:**

Clearly state the necessary knowledge, including intermediate or beginner projects that should be completed first.

**Instructions:**

Provide more abstract guidance rather than step-by-step instructions.  Allow contributors to take ownership of implementation.
1. Define your project structure (e.g., build a microservice-based application, a complex game engine).
2. Implement advanced features (e.g., caching, authentication, user management, deployment).
3. Optimize performance (e.g., database queries, code refactoring).
4. Deploy and scale (for full-stack projects, guide them to deploy on cloud platforms).

**Expected Output:**

Describe or show what a successful completion looks like (e.g., screenshots, expected performance benchmarks).

**Challenges/Extensions:**

Encourage contributors to expand the project (e.g., scale the app for multiple users, implement CI/CD).

**Additional Resources:**

Provide links to in-depth documentation, tools, and libraries relevant to the project.

> [!NOTE]
> Projects **do not have to be language-specific**.
> - **Advanced Projects**: Can be language-agnostic, focusing more on architecture and complex systems.  However, it's helpful to offer guidance on which languages or technologies are suited for the projects (e.g., Docker for containerization, AWS for cloud deployment).
