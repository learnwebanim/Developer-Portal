## Welcome to the Intermediate Projects
Here, we collect intermediate-level project ideas to help developers learn and grow by working on practical, hands-on projects.

**What to Contribute?**
Projects that involve more complex features such as API integrations, user authentication, or object-oriented programming.  These are perfect for developers who have mastered the basics and are ready for a challenge.

**Guidelines:**
- Provide clear instructions for setting up the project environment.
- Include code comments and explanations where necessary.
- If applicable, add a **README.md** file that outlines the project scope, goals, and any dependencies.

By contributing here, you're helping other developers learn through practical coding challenges!
