# Intermediate Project Template

**Project Title:**

Give a meaningful title that reflects the project's slightly advanced nature.

**Overview:**
Describe the project in detail.  Explain what the project does and what intermediate skills will be learned.
- **Objective**: What iwll the contributor learn? (e.g., working with APIs, data manipulation, more complex algorithms)

**Technologies/Languages:**

Mention any foundational knowledge or beginner projects that the contributor should complete first.

**Instructions:**

Step-by-step instructions, similar to the beginner project but with more complexity.
1. Set up your development environment.
2. Implement core features (e.g., build a weather app that uses an external API).
3. Add advanced functionality (e.g., error handling, authentication, data storage).
4. Test and debug the project.

**Expected Output:**

Include a description or visual representation of the finished project.

**Challenges/Extensions:**

Provide optional challenges for further exploration (e.g., add a new feature, refactor the code).

**Additional Resources:**

Links to API documentation, advanced tutorials, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Projects **do not have to be language-specific**.
> - **Intermediate Projects**: Could encourage usng certain languages based on the complexity (e.g., JavaScript for front-end apps, Python for data manipulation).
